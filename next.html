<h3> Creation of NeXT </h3>
<p>NeXT was founded by Steve Jobs in 1985 for $7 million. After only 1 year and no product to show for it, Steve Jobs sought a venture capitalist. Ross Perot heavily invested in the NeXT company. On October 12, 1988 at the Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall in San Francisco, the NeXT Computer was officially released and stirred up a multimedia frenzy and was referred to as Steve Jobs' <cite>comeback event</cite>.</p>
<p>The NeXT computer was available to the market in 1990 and was being sold for $9,999. However it was dismissed by the education sector (the main purpose it was designed) due to the high costs.</p>
<p>The NeXTCUBE was added to the market that same year and was a <cite>interpersonal</cite> computer. Shortly after its release, the addition of NeXTMAIL multimedia email system, was created. With this system, you could send emails with videos, images, graphics, and voice for the first time in history.</p>
<p>In 1993, after selling only 50,000 computers, NeXT transitioned to solely making software with the release of NeXTSTEP/Intel. For the first time in its history, the NeXT Company reported a profit of $1.03 Million.</p>

<h3> Homecoming to Apple </h3>
<p>In 1996, Apple announced that it would be buying NeXT for $427 millions. The purchase was final in February 1997. With that purchase, Steve Jobs was restored to the Apple throne, ousting then-CEO Gil Amelio in July 1997.</p>
<p>In March 1998, Steve Jobs made it his mission to return Apple to profitability. In doing so, he killed many projects that Apple was working on such as, Newton, Cyberdog, and OpenDoc. Employees were deathly afraid of getting stuck on an elevator with Steve Jobs in the fear that when the doors opened, they would no longer have a job, which happened, but rarely. Steve Jobs also changed the licencing agreementsfor companies making Apple clones to make it so cost-prohibitive that no manufacturer would want to make clones.</p>
<p>With Apples' purchase of NeXT, and the merging of the two softwares, gave birth to Mac OS X (formerly NEXTSTEP) and MobileMe (formerly NeXTMAIL). With the releases of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and the iTunes Store, Apples' future was set in stone.</p>
