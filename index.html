<h3>Father of the iPod</h3>
<p>The iPod grew out of Steve Jobs’ digital hub strategy. Life was going digital. People were plugging all kinds of devices into their computers: digital cameras and MP3 players. The computer was the central device, that could manage a large music library. While they were doing this, they discovered that all the early MP3 players were horrible. Jobs asked his top hardware guy, Jon Rubinstein, to see if Apple could do better.</p>

<h3>Father of the iPhone</h3>
<p>On January 9, 2007, Steve Jobs put sneaker to Macworld stage to give one of the most incredible keynote presentations of his life — a life filled with incredible keynotes — and in the history of consumer electronics. There, he said he would be introducing a wide-screen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet device. But it wasn't three products. It was one product. We got it. It was the iPhone.</p>

<h3>Father of the iPad</h3>
<p>On January 27, 2010, Steve Jobs took the stage at an Apple special event to give what was one of the most important keynotes of his life and, once again, in the history of consumer electronics. The Mac had been introduced decades before, the iPhone only a few years prior to that and yet on that stage, at that event, Jobs would make the case that there was room for a cross between the two. Hence the iPad was introduced.</p>
