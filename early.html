<h3>Atari & Spiritual Searching</h3>
<p>Steve Jobs attended Reed College in Oregon from 1972 until the summer of 1973 when he moved back to California. In the Spring of 1974 he was working at Atari trying to save enough money to travel to India to seek spiritual enlightenment. Jobs left for India in the Summer of 1974 with Daniel Kottke and the first stop was intended to be Neem Karoli Baba, however his ashram was deserted because Baba died in the Summer of 1973. Kottke and Jobs then sought out Haidakhan Babaji, where they received the spiritual guidance they had been looking for. Jobs left India 7 months later. When he returned, Steve Jobs spent a time at a commune in Oregon called <cite>All One Farm</cite></p>
